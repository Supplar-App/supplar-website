            </ol>
            <p class="lead pb-1 pt-3">Intellectual Property</p>
            The intellectual property in the materials in Supplar are owned by or licensed to Supplar. You may download
            Supplar, to view, use, and display the application on your mobile device for your personal use only.<br><br>
            This constitutes the grant of a license, not a transfer of title. This license shall automatically terminate
            if you violate any of these restrictions or these Terms of Service, and may be terminated by Supplar at any
            time.
            <p class="lead pb-1 pt-3">Automatic Updates</p>
            You give us permission to download and install updates to Supplar on your device in accordance with your
            privacy preferences. This permission can be revoked at any time by deleting Supplar from your device.
            <p class="lead pb-1 pt-3">Liability</p>
            Supplar and the materials in Supplar are provided on an 'as is' basis. To the extent permitted by law,
            Supplar makes no warranties, expressed or implied, and hereby disclaims and negates all other warranties
            including, without limitation, implied warranties or conditions of merchantability, fitness for a particular
            purpose, or non-infringement of intellectual property, or other violation of rights.<br><br>
            In no event shall Supplar or its suppliers be liable for any consequential loss suffered or incurred by you
            or any third party arising from the use or inability to use Supplar, or any other services provided by
            Supplar or the materials in Supplar, even if Supplar or an authorized representative has been notified,
            orally or in writing, of the possibility of such damage.<br><br>
            In the context of this agreement, “consequential loss” includes any consequential loss, indirect loss, real
            or anticipated loss of profit, loss of benefit, loss of revenue, loss of business, loss of goodwill, loss of
            opportunity, loss of savings, loss of reputation, loss of use and/or loss or corruption of data, whether
            under statute, contract, equity, tort (including negligence), indemnity, or otherwise.<br><br>
            Because some jurisdictions do not allow limitations on implied warranties, or limitations of liability for
            consequential or incidental damages, these limitations may not apply to you.
            <p class="lead pb-1 pt-3">Accuracy of Materials</p>
            The materials appearing in Supplar are not comprehensive and are for general information purposes only. To
            the extent permitted by law, Supplar does not warrant or make any representations concerning the accuracy,
            likely results, or reliability of the use of the materials in Supplar, or otherwise relating to such
            materials or on any resources linked to Supplar.
            <p class="lead pb-1 pt-3">Links</p>
            Supplar has not reviewed all of the sites linked to Supplar or on its corresponding website and is not
            responsible for the contents of any such linked site. The inclusion of any link does not imply endorsement,
            approval, or control by Supplar of the site. Use of any such linked website is at your own risk and we
            strongly advise you make your own investigations with respect to the suitability of those sites.
            <p class="lead pb-1 pt-3">Notice regarding Apple</p>

            Apple has no obligation to furnish you with any maintenance and support services with respect to
            Supplar.<br><br>
            If Supplar fails to conform to any applicable warranty, you may notify Apple and Apple will refund the
            purchase price of the mobile application to you. To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, Apple
            will have no other warranty obligation whatsoever with respect to Supplar and any other claims, losses,
            liabilities, damages, costs, or expenses attributable to any failure to conform to any warranty will be our
            responsibility.<br><br>
            Apple is not responsible for addressing any claims by you or any third party relating to Supplar or your use
            of Supplar, including but not limited to (1) product liability claims; (2) any claim that our mobile
            application fails to conform to any applicable legal or regulatory requirement; and (3) claims arising under
            consumer protection or similar legislation.<br><br>
            Apple is not responsible for the investigation, defence, settlement, and discharge of any third-party claim
            that our mobile application infringes that third party’s intellectual property rights.<br><br>
            You agree to comply with any applicable third-party terms when using Supplar, including any Usage Rules set
            forth in the Apple App Store Agreement of Service.<br><br>
            Apple and Apple’s subsidiaries are third-party beneficiaries of these Terms of Service, and upon your
            acceptance of these Terms of Service, Apple will have the right (and will be deemed to have accepted the
            right) to enforce these Terms of Service against you as a third-party beneficiary of these Terms of
            Service.<br><br>
            You hereby represent and warrant that (1) you are not located in a country that is subject to a U.S.
            Government embargo, or that has been designated by the U.S. Government as a "terrorist supporting" country;
            and (2) you are not listed on any U.S. Government list of prohibited or restricted parties.
            <p class="lead pb-1 pt-3">Right to Terminate</p>
            We may suspend or terminate your right to use Supplar and these Terms of Service immediately upon written
            notice to you for any breach of these Terms of Service.
            <p class="lead pb-1 pt-3">Severance</p>
            Any term of these Terms of Service which is wholly or partially void or unenforceable is severed to the
            extent that it is void or unenforceable. The validity of the remainder of these Terms of Service is not
            affected.
            <p class="lead pb-1 pt-3">Governing Law</p>
            These Terms of Service are governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of Russia. You irrevocably
            submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts in that State or location.<br><br>
